          <h3>Why does cryptocurrency exist?</h3>
          <p>Cryptocurrency was originally created as an incentive for people from all over the web to use their computers to verify digital transactions.  People would use their computer to check digital transactions to make sure the accounting was done correctly.  When many people check digital accounting of this decentralized ledger system, which is called blockchain, the web is more secure.  To reward people for using their resources to make the web safer, a digital currency called Bitcoin was created in 2009 to keep track of how many transactions people had checked.  Now, in the year 2021, there are thousands of cryptocurrencies out there which perform different valuable functions such as transmitting funds across the world, decentralizing financial systems, and bringing meme-y wackiness to investing.</p>

          <h2>What should I know before investing?</h2>
          <p>Investing in cryptocurrency is a risky way to make money.  Coins gain and lose value similar to how stocks do, but the changes in their value is generally considered to be more volatile and unpredictable than stock behavior.  That means money can be gained very quickly and lost very quickly.  Exercise caution before you invest in cryptocurrency and think about if the purchase is a good idea.
