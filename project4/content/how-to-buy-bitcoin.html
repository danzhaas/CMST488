    <li>Buy at select ATMs</li>
</ol>
<p> Let's go one by one and see how easy it is to get each one. <br><br> <strong> 1. Buy With PayPal </strong><br><br>
    <i>Notice: the author works for PayPal, but receives no incentive for this article. </i> <br><br> To buy with PayPal,
    open the PayPal app on your smartphone. Create an account if you don't have one already. Here, you may be prompted
    to complete a form similar to what you might see at a Bank since you will be making monetary transactions. This
    information is secure with PayPal; you probably shared most of this information with them to use their services
    before. <i> Note: There are many untrustworthy services which sell crypto, so before trying to buy on other
        platforms which ask for your personal information, do your research! Find out as much as you can about the
        security of those platforms before you share your financial or personally identifying data. PayPal is widely
        considered secure. </i>
        <br><br>
        Click the 'Crypto' button on the bottom of the screen. You will see a list of
    cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin is at the top - click Bitcoin. Next you'll see a screen with a graph showing how much
    Bitcoin costs right now. It's a very expensive coin: over $56,000 as of May 10 2021, but don't worry, you can spend
    whatever amount you like and buy just a fraction of a Bitcoin. Then click the Buy button. Here you will be prompted
    to read a statement so you as a customer have been informed of the nature of cryptocurrency. Read it, and if you
    agree, hit the agree button. 
    <br><br>
    Next, choose the amount of money you want to spend on Bitcoin and fill that in the
    amount field. There is a transaction fee of $0.50 and a fee of some size is to be expected for any cryptocurrency
    purchases. Click Buy. <br><br>You should now see some confetti on your screen. Congratulations, you have bought your
    first Bitcoin!  </p>
