<h2>What is the Blockchain?</h2>
<h3>This system so valuable that Bitcoin is a reward for contributing.  What is it?</h3>

<p>Blockchain can be described as a decentralized network and a consensus mechanism.  That means it operates from many different locations and computers, and it serves as a source of truth and to account for digital transactions.  <br><br>Here's an example of a small problem blockchain can solve:  If one bank sends money to another bank online, and the second bank claims it didn't receive anything, how could the first bank know for sure if the money arrived at its destination?  After all, mistakes are made and bugs cause money to be sent to the wrong place sometimes.  But it's also plausible the second bank is dishonest and looking to get double the payment by lying about losing the first amount.  With only the two parties in on the transaction, it's "my word against theirs".  Thanks to Blockchain, there are computers all over the world to serve as a third party for these transactions and bring consensus in the case of any disputes.  This is known as "triple entry accounting" and it makes the web more secure for everyone. </p>
